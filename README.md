This is a note taker app that provides the user with the ability to write, save and delete notes inside their browser.

## installation

Be sure to install all required node dependencies: Express, Path, FS and shortID. Open the folder in a terminal, and run 'npm i'.

## usage

Running the server file in node will direct users to their local host. In the browser, text boxes are filled in, with corresponding routes in Javascript to recieve, read, and properly update the data.

## issues

As of now, the server connects and the app is viewable on a browser. i am not receiving full functionality out of the notes section and need to troubleshoot asap. I suspect the issue is on the apiRoutes.js sheet. Once I receive full functionality I will re-upload to heroku.
